# Retail Customer Segmentation Through RFM and Customer Lifetime Value Analysis
<p align="justify">The dataset that is studied to discover customer insights and how different marketing channels impacts their purchase behavior has been provided by a multichannel company with sales of several hundred million dollars per year. The company has a network of retail stores, a well-established traditional catalog channel and a website. Its brand is very well known nationally (US) and it has a strong positive reputation along with very good long term customer loyalty. The core of the company’s business consists of food products which are often purchased as gifts during the Christmas season. This project explores this dataset and visualizes key components such as VIP customer spending, marketing channel conversion rate and order method splits before producing a more detailed section on RFM segmentation and the process involving the calculation for customer lifetime value. The data is initially pushed to a local PostgreSQL database and queired using the SQLAlchemy ORM library and Psycopg2 in order to prepare various tables needed for the investifation. RFM segmentation is a great method to identify groups of customers for special treatment because it allows marketers to target specific clusters of customers with communications that are much more relevant for their particular behavior – and thus generate much higher rates of response, plus increased loyalty and customer lifetime value.</p>
